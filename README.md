# Data Analysis for Agricultural Policy Analysis
This repository contains two (partly) ongoing projects that may provide some ideas for how agricultural economics rely on data analysis. <br> 
  * The folder “Econometric-Mathematical-Programming” includes my master’s thesis as a PDF file and the Python code to implement some very basic classification tasks related to GHG emissions of dairy farms, comparing KNN classification Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. Note that the data preparation and the simulations for my thesis were implemented with Stata and GAMS, respectively. The GAMS code is available upon request.  <br>
  * The folder “Satellite Imagery Analysis” contains a new project in which I experiment with the analysis of freely accessible satellite imagery from the Sentinel 1 and 2 satellites launched by the EU’s Copernicus programme using Python Rasterio. I calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for four different sites in Rheinhessen, Germany, over several months. The images below show the natural color image (left) and the NDVI (right) of a cropland-dominated site in May 2021, near the city of Mainz (note the football stadium of Mainz 05). The NDVI is calculated for a cropland site, a forest site, a site dominated by vineyards and an urban area. The sum of the NDVI in each pixel of the respective site is displayed for each of the four spots throughout the year 2021 (bottom image). <br>
