# Data Analysis for Agricultural Policy Analysis
This repository contains two (partly ongoing) projects that may provide some ideas for how agricultural economics rely on data analysis. <br> 
  * The folder “Econometric-Mathematical-Programming” includes my master’s thesis as a PDF file and the Python code to implement some very basic classification tasks related to GHG emissions of dairy farms, comparing KNN classification Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. Note that the data preparation and the simulations for my thesis were implemented with Stata and GAMS, respectively. The GAMS code is available upon request.  <br>
  * The folder "Satellite Imagery Analysis" is a new project
